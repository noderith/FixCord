# Discord CSS Fixes & Themes

This repository contains visual-only CSS fixes and themes for Discord clients and web. Themes are intended for personal use and visuals only.

**Safety note:** These are CSS files only â€” no tokens, no servers, no scraping. Do not add external imports from untrusted domains.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for how to submit themes.
